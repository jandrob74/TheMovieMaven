This project hits all required requirements.

1. This project is fully responsive. I tested it on multiple browsers on multiple computers. There is a responsive newsletter signup popup that is visible on large screens, but it does not show on smaller screens. The navigation menu turns to a hamburger menu on smaller devices. I have several media queries to change page elements for different screen sizes.
2. The project has more than 3 custom-written CSS selectors/rules.
3. This project has the required javascript. One is for the subscribe popup and the other is for fitting the header image to fit the way I needed.
4. All files, (HTML, CSS, JS) have comments for clarification and noting major sections of code.
5. This is a unique project.
